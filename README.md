## Add Local Connection

It is recommended that you first create the repository in GitHub before you start adding files and code in the local folder. To do this:<br>
1. Create a [new repository](https://github.com/new) on GitHub
2. Open the cmd and use the command ```cd path``` where path is the location you want to have your local folder.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Note that the final destination of the repository would be ```path\repo_name```*
3. Now access the repo folder by ```cd repo_name```
4. Use ```git clone repo_link```. You can find the repo link on your repository, under code, under HTTPS
